#### **Web Mapping: Lab 3**
##### My First Web Map

###### Abbey Rankins

This Web Mapping lab provides students with hands-on experience in creating their very own interactive web maps using GPX files and the GeoJSON format. Beginning with planning routes and marking stops on Google Maps, students export the data as GPX files. 

Using GeoJSON.io, students convert their edited GPX files into GeoJSON format and refine routes or add supplementary data, like location names for their intermediary stops. This enables the creation of customizable and interactive web maps. This process allows students to visualize their data in a spatial context and explore various mapping functionalities. By guiding students through the conversion and customization of geographic data, the lab fosters a deeper understanding of web mapping principles and equips students with practical skills for spatial data visualization and web mapping applications.
